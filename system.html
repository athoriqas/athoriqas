          </h2>
          <p class="text-secondary">JAKARTA, KOMPAS.com - Si Doel The Movie won two awards at the same time from the Indonesian World Record Museum (MURI) as the first Indonesian film to be broadcast and a Gala Premiere in the Netherlands and an award as an Indonesian film with a Gala Premiere for two consecutive days.

            <br><br>

            The award was delivered directly by the founder of the Indonesian World Record Museum, Jaya Suprana, on the stage for the premiere of the film Si Doel The Movie at XXI Epicentrum, Rasuna Said, South Jakarta, Sunday (29/7/2018).
            
            <br><br>
            
            With this record achievement, the role artist who is also the director of Rano Karno admitted that he did not expect it.
            
            <br><br>
            
            "This is the highest thing for me. To be honest, I didn't expect Pak Jaya to monitor us. Maybe in language, he followed artists for a long time and I was in it," said Rano.
            
            <br><br>
            
            This is because, from the start, Frederica as a producer from Falcon Pictures only conveyed to Rano that the gala premiere would be held at the same time as the Betawi cultural event.</p>

            After the 2019 Indonesian Movie Actors (IMA) Awards' Favorite Main Male Actor was won by Gading Marten through the film Love For Sale, the Best Main Male Actor was won by veteran actor Rano Karno, Thursday (14/3/2019). This award was chosen directly by the jury consisting of different backgrounds.

            Even though he has been absent from the film industry for so long, Rano's acting skills in every film are unquestionable. To win this prestigious award at the 2019 IMA Awards is not easy. The reason is, in this category, Rano has to compete with other talented actors who are much younger than him. They are Adipati Dolken, Ario Bayu, Augie Fantinus, Dion Wiyoko, Gading Marten and Ringgo Agus Rahman.
            <br><br>
            In his remarks when receiving this award, Rano said Si Doel The Movie 2 would be released on Eid al-Fitr 2019.</p>

          </h2>
          <p class="text-secondary">jpnn.com, JAKARTA - Actor Angga Yunanda said he was surprised to learn that the film Mariposa was included in Google's search list for 2020. He did not expect that the film he starred in with Zara, ex-JKT48, would receive such high enthusiasm. "It's really amazing to see the Mariposa film on Google's trending list this year along with other films," said Angga Yunanda, Saturday (12/12).

            "At first, I never expected with the enthusiasm of all my friends to become one of the trending ones on Google," he continued. According to Angga, there are many factors that have made the film Mariposa one of Google's trending ranks throughout 2020. "What is certain is that I am very grateful and can't wait to see this film re-run in theaters on December 31," he concluded.

            It is known, throughout 2020, there were five Indonesian films most searched for based on the Year in Search 2020 list released by Google.com. The five films compete between popular Korean film and drama titles such as Crash Landing on You, It's Okay to Not Be Okay, to the film Mulan. Interestingly, Mariposa, which will return on December 31, 2020, is one of the most searched films on Google. (jlo/jpnn)</p>
